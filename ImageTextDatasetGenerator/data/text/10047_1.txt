This failed exercise in satire or commentary on the human condition easily earned a place as one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen.
I'm seriously considering buying a copy, if I can find one dirt cheap, to chase away unwanted company.
It's honestly that bad.
I view it as some kind of anti-personnel weapon.
If you're the kind of person who just has to see a train wreck to witness the carnage, then this movie is a gem.
Just to be fair, Kelsey Grammar's character has 1 line that almost works, but doesn't quite.
If you are familiar with the term "word vomit" then you may get some picture of the cinematrocity.
Oh, and the narrative structure is ill conceived, pretentious and amateurish.
It has failed on both style and substance.
But that probably violates some provision in the Geneva Conventions.
