While the premise of the film sounded unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the film I could have stopped there and gone on with my life.
If a guy said a filthy comment, grabbed her, or made some disgusting gesture to her, I would say go for it, bring him down, he's a pig.
I have much respect for women.
I was raised by one.
I also come from a Spanish family and we are very matriarchal.
