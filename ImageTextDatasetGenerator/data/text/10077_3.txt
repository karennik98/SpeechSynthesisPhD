(A possible minor spoiler) The first "Jurassic Park" was an effective, but silly film that did it's job and was actually pretty good.
The sequel "The Lost World" had a few decent moments, but those were ruined by the lame end portion of the film which had a T-Rex running amok in San Diego.
The bottom line is it's not a very good film, even as a thrill ride.
* out of 4 stars.
