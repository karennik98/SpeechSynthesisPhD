This film is on my list of worst movies ever made.
The story is disconnected and it is difficult to understand what is going on or the reason for the characters' actions.
All films need to have an inner logic, and this film just doesn't have it - the story doesn't make any sense.
To see Faye Dunaway, Christopher Plummer and Diana Quick wasting their talents in this movie is a crime.
Faye Dunaway is the lucky one, because she plays the victim and gets killed early in the film.
If Dame Agatha Christie were alive she would die laughing!
The movie is that bad!
