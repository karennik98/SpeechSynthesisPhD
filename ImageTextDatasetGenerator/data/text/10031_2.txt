All the criticisms of this movie are quite valid!
It is pretty boring, and filled with all kinds of pointless ridiculous stuff.
A couple exchanging nods over their "good grub."
A medium shot of a desk as a phone rings until someone finally comes, sits down, and answers it at a pretty leisurely pace.
Quadruple-takes or more when people look at things.
Solitary banjo-tuning and playing, taking a break for a beer.
The sharing of cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread, which to the squeamish become unpalatable when there's talk of people burned in a fire.
Otherwise, it's simply not very interesting, and would probably try the patience of even the most hardcore outdoors-slasher fan.
