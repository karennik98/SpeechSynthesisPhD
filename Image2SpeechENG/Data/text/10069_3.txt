But then no one would need to see the film.
That explains why the film seems to have little or no purpose other than to demonstrate state-of-the-art special effects.
Sure, there are a few clever scenes and some moderately funny bits, but no meaningful plot line to tie them together.
The dinosaur puppets and animation in JP3 are very good to excellent, and more numerous than ever.
Even at that, I found myself frequently checking my wristwatch.
The audience I saw it with left the theater in silence.A better bet: see the movie LEGALLY BLONDE.Dave
