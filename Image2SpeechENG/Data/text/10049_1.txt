What if someone made a horror movie that was completely devoid of plot?Well, I think it would probably end up a little bit like this one.
I don't think I've ever seen a move was so steady it its slide from hackneyed (at the beginning) to complete crap (by the end).
I only stuck with it, because I kept thinking it couldn't possibly get worse.
One would think there'd at least be some humor value... but not here.
