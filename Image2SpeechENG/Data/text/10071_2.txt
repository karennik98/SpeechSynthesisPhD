Did people expect "Jurassic Park 3" to be full of surprises?
Not one moment of it is worth it.
Many elements could easily scare people out of the movies...and it's not the dinos!
Tea Leoni...I think she's a great actress, but I'm sorry to say that this time she reached the bottom line.
Alessandro Nivola - "have you ever heard of something called facial expression?
Fellings, emotions..."..he's got to work harder on that!
Sam Neil, no big deal.
The soundtrack...got to change that record, or you get tired of it.
