To knowledge this is the only eyewitness account ever penned.
The filmmaker should be credited for accuracy but there is little to say about the production and acting quality.
The acting was theatrical and the sound and picture quality was extremely poor.
It appears that the filmmaker simply shot scenes of the reported events that took place without incorporating or weaving them into a flowing plot or story line.
If you must know the story, read about it, its much more gripping and conclusive.
