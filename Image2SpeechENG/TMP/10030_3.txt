Ground truth:
The plot is your basic killer in the woods again.
But ironically this was filmed before Friday the 13th.
The prey was actually shot sometime in 1978 according to one of the actors in an interview years later.
But released for about a week at some drive ins, (yes Jim, namans drive in showed this in June of 84).
But it has a dated look to it.
Maybe they released it so later on to cash in on all the other terror films the market was flooded with by 1984.
Now on the story, it has some kind of back story, a forest fire back in the 1940's leaves a lot of Gypsies burned to death.
The tag line for this picture claims ITS NOT HUMAN, AND ITS GOT AN AXE, but an Axe was only used in these first two killings.
Now we have a bunch of teenagers who look like they in their mid 20's camping.
We all know they are the Prey, and the monster knocks them of one by one.
For an 80 minute movie it seems longer.
We also have a lot of wildlife footage to fill in voids for the 80 mins.
Overall for being out into an 80-'s horror movie it looks way more 70's than ever.
Hey the Prey had potential to be a good horror killer in the woods movie but falls a little short..
It does however feature a pretty scary cool looking monster at the end, and we have to wait till the last 2 minutes to see him.
Side note, the monster has gone on to star in the Addams family movies in the 1990's..
