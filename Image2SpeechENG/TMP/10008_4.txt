Ground truth:
20th Century-Fox musical has a glossy veneer yet seems a bit tatty around the edges.
It is very heavy on the frenetic, gymnastic-like dancing, exceedingly thin on story.
Betty Grable (an eleventh hour replacement for Alice Faye) gives it a boost, even though she's paired with leaden Don Ameche (in tan make-up and slick hair).
Also good: Charlotte Greenwood as Betty's pithy aunt, a limousine driver who's constantly asleep on the job, and Carmen Miranda playing herself (who else?).
The stock shots of Argentina far outclass the action filmed on the Fox backlot, and some of the supporting performances are quite awful.
By the time of the big horserace finale, most viewers will have had enough.
*1/2 from ****
