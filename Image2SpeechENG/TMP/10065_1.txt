Ground truth:
The Adventures of Hercules has to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie I've yet run across.
You would have to look far and wide to find anything that approaches the level of ineptness on display in this movie.
Acting Â– Bad.
Editing Â– Bad.
Direction Â– Bad.
Special Effects Â– Bad and Laughable.
Plot Â– Bad.
Lighting Â– Bad.
Cinematography Â– Bad.
Costume Design Â– Bad and Silly.
Everything Else Â– Bad.
Watching The Adventures of Hercules is about as enjoyable as a root canal.
Even for a fan of bad movies, it's a real endurance test.
This is one for either masochists or Lou Ferrigno completists (if any exist).Eight things I learned from watching The Adventures of Hercules: 1.
If you don't have the budget for real special effects, rotoscope a scene from the previous movie.
It will look great - trust me.2.
When on a quest to recover Zeus' thunderbolts, take time for frequent stops to oil-up you body.
It worked for Ferrigno and his two Amazon companions.3.
Some of the ancient Greek gods dressed like extras from Star Wars.5.
If you need to pad your crappy movie's runtime, extend the title sequence by adding Star Trek style credits and throw in some overly grandiose music.
It also helps if you've got a previous movie to pull scenes from.6.
Fight scenes move along much smoother if the bad guys attack Hercules one at a time.7.
William Berger did anything for money.8.
I didn't think it was possible, but The Adventures of Hercules makes the first film, Hercules (1983), look like an Academy Award winner.

Theres an inexplicably high number of episodes in which Hercules is turned into an animal. 2. If said transformation is into a lion, itll be accompanied by a cheesy rock song. 3. Theres an even higher number of episodes in which Hercules is turned into a rock. 4. Lou Ferrigno is incapable of conveying subtlety or pathos. 5. The show is shot entirely on location in Sicily. 6. Most of the extras are either local yokels or British tourists. 7. Theres an inordinate amount of product placement for a show that wasnt actually sponsored by anyone. 8. Theres no denying that its weirdly watchable.
