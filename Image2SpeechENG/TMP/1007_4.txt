Ground truth:
I was disappointed with the third film in the "Death Wish" series and wouldn't recommend this unless you are really into Bronson.
He is his usual self in this one, maybe a bit lighter hearted than in the others; the rest of the cast is good if your watching a movie of the week on T.V.
The film takes a while to get going and then when it finally does, it gets out of control to the point of ridiculousness.
Skip this and go on to the 4th installment which I highly recommend.
