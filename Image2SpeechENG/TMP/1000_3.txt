Ground truth:
I felt like this film could have done a whole lot better than it did.
I felt like it kept leading the viewer up to a big event that never materialized.
So, I have to give it a lower rating than I would have liked to and say that it fell short of my expectations.


Corrected:
I felt like this film could have done a whale lot better than it did. I felt like it kept leading the viewer up to a big event.
So, "If I have to give it a star rating, I would have liked it to be five stars, but it's more like four and a half."
My expectations, for the most part, were met. The food was good, the staff was attentive, and the room was comfortable. I did, however, find the music to be a bit too loud.
