Ground truth:
However, I can say that I wish I had seen this other movie instead of the one I saw!
I enjoyed Betsy Palmer's chilling performance in Friday THE 13TH.
It is painful to watch because it is just downright boring.Reading the positive reviews for this movie, I could only identify three possibilities.
The first possibility - these authors were involved in the production in some way.
The second possibility - the authors whilst not directly involved were paid to write positive reviews after production was completed.
James Johnston receives a visit from two journalists eager to hear the story of the Bell Witch.
The story is told as a series of flashbacks.
A series of supernatural events begin happening at the home of John Bell and his family.
And then some!First, the acting.
The acting is almost uniformly terrible right across the board.
This factor does the most damage to the production, undermining any possible credibility of belief or interest on the part of the viewer.
The voice of the vengeful spirit sounds more like a teenage girl experiencing teenage angst rather than a powerful demonic force expressing malevolent intent.
I almost laughed when I heard some of her lines.
Unfortunately, this voice began to become very annoying very quickly!
The direction is haphazard and very uneven.
Some scenes show promise but potential is squandered by the clearly inexperienced director.
Nothing is done with the camera, with sound or with lighting to add intensity to the scenes intended to be scary.
The atmosphere is equally flat.
A vengeful spirit is supposedly behind supernatural occurrences.
Yet the effects are so incredibly inept that no one who has seen a proper horror movie would buy into them.
I'll give one example.
In one scene, the spirit attacks someone.
See the scene for yourself.
It's almost funny - almost.Third, the script.
Whilst it may be the case that the events shown are faithful to accounts of real occurrences, it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring.
Scenes as short as two minutes feel much longer thanks to the poor dialogue - dialogue that fails to add depth to the characters or story.
This movie is far too reliant on conversations to advance the story.
Peter Cushing for example could read a telephone directory and still hold attention of the viewers.
The same cannot be said of the actors in THE HAUNT.Finally, the humour.
The ill-guided attempts at humour in this movie are excruciating.
An obese boy is the butt of many jokes.
One particularly awful scene sees the said boy going to the outside toilet.
The decision to shoot the picture near the original location helped add some authenticity.
The costumes were also well chosen.Overall, THE HAUNT is an appalling movie.
It is not even in the "so bad it's good" league.
It is instead just boring.
I advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague.
Don't even bother seeing it for free!I have never seen the other movie about the Bell Witch.
But it really couldn't be any worse than THE HAUNT.
Could it?
THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, RINGU, THE GRUDGE (Japanese original) and ONE MISSED CALL (Japanese original) are good places to start.
