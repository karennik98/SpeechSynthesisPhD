Ground truth:
Filmed in Arizona by a mostly-foreign crew, "Nightkill" is one of the clumsiest crime dramas I have ever seen.
Robert Mitchum (in a cowboy hat) trails recently-widowed Jaclyn Smith around, hoping to figure out if she had a hand in her husband's death.
Don't be drawn in by the video box art of Jaclyn screaming while taking a shower.
She does indeed take a shower in this film, but it is not revealing (nor does it further the murky plot one iota).
NO STARS from ****
