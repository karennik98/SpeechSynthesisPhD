Ground truth:
It was awful plain and simple.
What was their message?
Where was the movie going with this?
It has all the ingredients of a sub-B grade movie.
From plotless storyline the bad acting to the cheesey slow-mo cinematography.
I'd sooner watch a movie I've already seen like Goodfellas, A Bronx Tale, even Grease.
There are NO likeable characters.
In the end you just want everyone to die already.
Save 2 hours of your life and skip this one.
