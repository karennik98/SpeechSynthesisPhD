Ground truth:
No other "famous" model thought of this, and it is very admirable for Tyra Banks to do so.
But as the series goes on and on I've come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.
Heck, I'm trying to see what happened to the ones that DID win, actually.This is the dream of some girls, and good for them.
That even made me think more of this as a sorry lot of folks.
Hence the name of the show.
Hence the sorry lot of judges, photographers, associations.
Hence Tyra and her consistent "this was me" plugs every camera angle you can get.
But then again, that IS the one thing I like about this show - the ex-model giving others who wouldn't have the chance -- a chance to enter the doors.
But after that...everything else is status quo for that industry which is why there are no surprises or week to week interest in the program.
