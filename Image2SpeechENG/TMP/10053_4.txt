Ground truth:
CAUTION SPOILER: At the end of the movie it is announced that the bridge collapsed just a few days after it was captured.
The impression is that the attack was all for nothing.
In reality, taking the bridge at Remagen was the last important victory for the Western Allies.
It was the crossing of the Rhine that the Allies had been trying to achieve for six months.
Because the Remagen Bridge was taken, the war ended in just a few weeks.The bridge only need to last for a day after it was captured.
The taking of the bridge was a complete success, and meant the that the end of the war was near, and would not last through the summer.
Contrary to the cynical nature of the film, the victory was heralded with elation by the troops who did it.
They knew how vital the battle was.This film has little to do with real history.
It was more a reflection of the cynical nature of the time in which it was produced.
