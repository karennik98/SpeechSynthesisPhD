Ground truth:
Everything everyone has said already pretty much rings true when it comes to 'The Prey'.
There's also a three minute banjo solo that shows off Bostwick's skill behind the instrument.
Not too bad if I do say so myself.The last ten minutes of the 'film' are its saving grace.
The ending still haunts me to this day.
This can also sport a short lived plus in that an early John Carl Bucheler does the special effects.
