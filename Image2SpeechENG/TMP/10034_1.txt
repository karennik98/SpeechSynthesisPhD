Ground truth:
I saw this movie with my girlfriend.
It was a total disaster.
You can really see it was cheaply made.
Badly scripted and with very bad acting.
I have read several versions of the book by different authors and also listened to one version on audio book.
We couldn't take the movie seriously because of the lacking elements it should have contained.
The experience of watching this was like The Blair Witch visits Green Acres.
Then there were parts that were vulgar.
They show this little boy using a bed pan and they actually show the contents of it.
The witch throws the contents of it on the boy and the whole family laughs.
I thought it was nasty and very strange.
I really can't understand why someone would think that would be entertaining.
It shows another scene where Dr. Mize arrives and Betsy Bell is urinating in her dress on the steps of their house in front of her mother and brothers.
Instead of the mother leading her off it is the brother.
How sick?
I think they should have left all of that out.
The makeup on the Reverend James Johnston as a older man didn't really make you assume he was older.
It made you think he was dipped in fish batter.
The blood on Joshua Gardner when he falls from the ladder is even worse.
The John Bell death scene looks like they got out flour and tried to do something with it to make him look as a serious sick man.
To me to much sickening comedy with bathroom problems and inexperienced people involved was the downfall of this picture.
These people would do better if they film commercials for local TV Stations for bathroom products.
They chose a good subject and were unable to produce it in a correct manner.
I rate this film Capital F minus.
