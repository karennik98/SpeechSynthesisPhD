Ground truth:
I would like to comment on how the girls are chosen.
why is that their are always more white women chosen then their are black women.
every episode their is always more white women then black one's.
as if to say white women are better looking then black women.
I would like for once see more black women then white.
and it not just your show it's like that in a lot of shows always more white's.
but i would have thought since you as the head honcho of the show you would see this yourself and have more black women on your show.
but you are just like the rest trying to act like you are so fair and nice.
you are just a big fony hypocrite.

Corrected:
I would like to comment on how the girls are chosen.
Why is that there are always more white women chosen then there are black women?
Every episode, their is always more white women then black ones.
As if to say, "White women are better looking than black women."
I would like to see more black women than white for once.
And it's not just your show; it's like that in a lot of shows. Always more whites.
But I would have thought, since you're the head honcho of the show, you would see this yourself and have more black women on your show.
But you are just like the rest, trying to act like you are so fair and nice.
You are just a big, phony hypocrite.
