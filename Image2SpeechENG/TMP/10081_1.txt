Ground truth:
When i went to see this i thought, i liked the first two and thought that they were very suspenseful so this one should be good also.
WRONG!
There was NO suspense and they don't explain about the new dinosaurs!
This movie was going through "the motions."
i thought that this movie had absolutely no plot and i thought that no one should waste their money to see it.

Corrected:
When I went to see this, I thought, "I liked the first two and thought that they were very suspenseful, so this one should be good, also."
"I want to no go"

"I want to know how to go"
There was no suspense, and they don't explain about the new dinosaurs!
This movie was going through the motions.
I thought that this movie had absolutely no plot and I thought that no one should waste their money to see it.
