Ground truth:
I have never seen so much talent and money used to produce anything so bad in my entire life!
I keep thinking of how it could be with the same cast, done the right way.
The film has even less intimacy than the Christopher Reeves 'Superman' movies.
The large cast makes the slick production even less effective than in those films, because there is not enough time to get to know anyone.
Dave Brubeck's progressive jazz soundtrack had me wondering if the wrong video was in the the case from the rental store.
The music became more and more offensive as the plot progressed.
It's hard to say whether the soundtrack or the annoying technique of repeating information from earlier scenes, was more offensive.
From someone who has seen most Christie films (that's what attracted me to this, it was one of the few I hadn't seen) miss this one.
It is not an Agatha Christie movie.
Golan-Globus are better suited to producing flicks about big time wrestling, rather than the snug atmosphere of English mystery.
