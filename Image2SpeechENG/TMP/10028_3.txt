Ground truth:
Foolish hikers go camping in the Utah mountains only to run into a murderous, disfigured gypsy.
The Prey is a pretty run of the mill slasher film, that mostly suffers from a lack of imagination.
The victim characters are all-too-familiar idiot teens which means one doesn't really care about them, we just wonder when they will die!
Not to mention it has one too many cheesy moments and is padded with endless, unnecessary nature footage.
However it does have a few moments of interest to slasher fans, the occasional touch of spooky atmosphere, and a decent music score by Don Peake.
Although one might be more rewarded to watch Just Before Dawn (1981), Wrong Turn (2003), or even The Final Terror (1983) again.* 1/2 out of ****
