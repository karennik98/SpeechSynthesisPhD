Ground truth:
JP3 lacks the Spielberg touch.
It's an all-out assault on the senses featuring "in your face" dinosaurs.
Watching this film was a bit like a roller coaster ride from hell.
The script is lame; it simultaneously asks and then leaves too many questions unanswered.
Also, we don't really get to appreciate the humans in the film for all they're worth.
For example, William H. Macy is too great a talent to have to compete with dino-thugs for our attention.
