Ground truth:
U won't get an answer until the end of the movie...Well, This is wat comedy is for the director Dibakar Banerjee!!!!!
Later u find out this scene has nothing to do with the actual movie and hence making everything obvious that the still described earlier was a dream.
Is this a film comedy?
Well it is supposed to belong to that category...
But it actually does not!!!
there is nothing that can be remotely associated with comedy in the movie!!!
More over the director gives the message that no one will get justice from Police!!!
so everyone must cheat the cheats!!!!
or forget about Justice!!!!
Music by Bapi-Tutul & Dhruv Dhalla is OK...
Nothing much to tell about other sectors... Bad script destroys everything... not even Anupam Kher's performance succeeds in making it at least a paisa vasool...
