Ground truth:
I would put Death Wish 3 in the same box as Stallone's Cobra and Commando.
The box that I would sell for $2 at a garage sale with all the videos inside.
The story is about the main character coming back from the previous movies' success to ruin it all with this load of trash.
Why did the makers want to destroy the reputation of the past 2 films with this cheap junk.
The story is so lame that had to be a outrageous sequel.
I mentioned Cobra earlier because it has the same mood, that one man can kill 20 or 30 gang members without a scratch.
Both this movie and Cobra were bent on showing the hero firing his guns at hip level and the enemy falling in large numbers.
Police officers spend hours at the shooting range so why did they get gunned down by gang members firing aimlessly from their hips?
This movie was so bad I thought for a minute it was Death Wish 4.
