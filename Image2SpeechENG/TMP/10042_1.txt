Ground truth:
I love ghost stories and I will sit through a movie til it's end, even if I'm not really enjoying it.
I rarely feel like I wasted my time...
BUT, this adaptation of the Bell Witch story was horrible!
It wasn't scary in the least bit.
What is with the comic relief moments?
The dialog was tedious.
Acting inconsistent The movie was WAY too long and some scenes were unnecessarily drawn out in my open.
