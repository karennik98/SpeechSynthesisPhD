Ground truth:
Producers Golan and Globus should have been ashamed to release this piece of trash publicly.
I know this is gonna sound cliched, but compared to this, the first "Hercules" of 1983 looks like a mature and exciting epic!
This "sequel" is moronic, cheap, unredeemable, childish, phony, inept and BADLY ACTED.
A landmark in bad cinema, and one of the few, few movies I've seen that REALLY deserve the lowest possible rating: no stars!
