Ground truth:
I walked into a book store in Brentwood, Tennessee.
I am not going to say the name because I am a dedicated customer.
I have been satisfied with every item I purchased there before this one.
On display in the front of the store was The Bell Witch Haunting.
(Might I mention this is the only store I have seen it for sale in.)
I had heard about the story somewhere and remembered it was supposed to have really happened for real.
I was very excited and couldn't wait to watch it.
I had great expectations for it.
I couldn't believe what I seen when I viewed it.
It didn't look like a real movie.
It looked like a home video.
I was under the impression it was suppose to be a horror movie.
I mean the movie was suppose to be about a witch haunting you know.
This is no horror movie.
You will not jump out of your seat watching this movie.
I gave the movie all the chances in the world to get better as it went along.
I swear I did.
It never did get any better.
There were several scenes of this little kid getting poop and pee thrown on him.
I didn't find that entertaining at all.
I watched the whole movie with disbelief that the store would actually sell this to me.
I guess that is how bad this economy has got.
I have this to say to the cast and crew.
Do not show this film as material to get other film jobs.
Don't do it.
I mean that sincerely.
I commend you for trying.
For people who have bought this.
I say this.
Don't sell your copy to someone.
They could get very upset.
Have a nice day everyone.
