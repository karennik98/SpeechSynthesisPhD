Ground truth:
I wanted to like this movie.
I really, really did.
I was so excited when I saw the preview, which scared the hell out of me.
But when I saw the actual film, I was disappointed.
The acting is stilted, and the attempts at comedy are woefully out of place and forced.
And I'm sorry, but a boy being chased by a turd in a bedpan is not funny or scary, it's just stupid.
I grew up on the Bell Witch legend, so I know quite a bit about it.
A lot of facts in the movie are right on target, but this film should have been much better.
The entire birthday party scene, for example, lasts about fifteen minutes, adds nothing to the plot or the story, and should have been left on the cutting room floor.
I'm just telling it like it is.
