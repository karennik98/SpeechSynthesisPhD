Ground truth:
Even by the lowered standards of '80s slasher movies, this one stinks.
The usual gaggle of oversexed teens heads for a "forbidden" part of forest, which burned in the 1940s and apparently left a sole angry survivor.
Finally, more killings--but nothing you haven't seen a zillion times before.
If you want to see the kids butchered, opt for SLEEPAWAY CAMP or the first FRIDAY THE 13TH over this
