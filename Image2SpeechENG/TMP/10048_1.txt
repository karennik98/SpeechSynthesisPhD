Ground truth:
The English translation of the title on the DVD version of this film is "Graveyard of Horrors," but I think that must be an error.
It should have been called "Graveyard of Horribles."
Horrible acting, horrible editing, horrible story, and horrible music all make this a horrible film best left in a horrible graveyard.Horrible.
