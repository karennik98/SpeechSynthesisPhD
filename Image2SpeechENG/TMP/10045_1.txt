Ground truth:
I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was awful; it was pointless and just plain stupid.
the supposed plot concerned a prospective bridegroom too caught up in the problems of the world to relate to his bride and the other people in his life.
It was trying to be profound but it wasn't; it was stupid and offensive.
If I wasn't on a bus I would have walked out on the movie.
Anyone considering seeing the movie or renting or buying the video you have been forewarned.
