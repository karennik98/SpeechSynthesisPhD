Ground truth:
This movie was perhaps the biggest waste of 2 hours of my life.
From the opening 10 minutes, I was ready to leave.
The cliches there slapping you in the face, and the plot was not only predictably stupid, but full of more holes than swiss cheese.
I am considering suing for that lost 2 hours, and $6.25 along with the fact that I am now stupider for watching this waste of film.
The T-Rex's must be flipping in their graves, so to speak.
