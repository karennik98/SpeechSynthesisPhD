Ground truth:
Supercraptastic slasher fare, which feels overly long at 80 minutes.
Years ago, a bunch of "gypsies" who lived in the caves of a mountain, were burned up in a forest fire.
Years later, campers are going missing from the area of the fire.
A bunch of horny kids are, of course, en route to this area for a debaucherous camping trip of there own.
Despite an ominous welcome from the forest ranger (Jackson Bostwick) the kids troop up to the mountain any way.
Before long, the kids start to get picked off by the monster, who remains unseen to the very end of the movie, probably because the makeup was so embarrassingly bad.
On the plus side, the wildlife footage is rather nice.
This is a far cry from Charlie Chaplin, but it was still nice to see him.
This is for slasher completists only.
