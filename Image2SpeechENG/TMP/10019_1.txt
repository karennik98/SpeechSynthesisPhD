Ground truth:
This is truly, without exaggerating, one of the worst Slasher movies ever made.
I know, it came out in the 80's following a tendency started by "Friday the 13th".
"The Prey" copies the fore-mentioned movie in many aspects.
The woods setting, the killer, the dumb teens, the gore, etc.But "The Prey" is as bad as you might expect.
I didn't even remember about it if it wasn't for coincidence.Well, the killer is in fact human so don't expect a supernatural killer in the likes of Jason.
The situations rather boring and lack of tension, gore, violence, etc.
It just does not works for a slasher flick.The acting is simply horrid.
The score is horrible!
a combination of boring instruments with cheesy 80's tunes?!
I won't even mention the technical aspects of the movie because believe me, it seems that it cost only 20 dollars.Please avoid this one like the plague.
It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that's something to say.
Thank God it seems to have vanished from earth.
