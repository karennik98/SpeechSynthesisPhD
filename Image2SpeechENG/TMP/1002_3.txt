Ground truth:
I was pulled into this movie early on, much to my surprise, because I hadn't intended to watch it at all.
Now I wish I hadn't.
Then the film abandons the hit-and-run to embark upon a misty exposition of two unrequited, all-suffering loves.
The screenwriter should have chosen one plot or the other.
At the end of the film, in the midst of the movie's second funeral, I found myself thinking, "Now, what does any of this have to do with that hit-and-run?"
The filmmakers may think the answer obvious, but I think the movie was plotted and executed flabbily.
