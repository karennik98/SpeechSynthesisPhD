Ground truth:
Nightkill stars Robert Mitchum as a world-weary private eye probing the case of a missing industrialist (Mike Connors).
He is hired by Jaclyn Smith, the anxious wife of the missing man.
What Jaclyn fails to inform Mitchum is that she knows full well her husband's whereabouts.
This is BAD cinema.
And this movie is sooooo poor.
It makes it look like Halloween mixed up with Trick Or Treats.
Avoid this.Rated R for Graphic Violence, Nudity and Sexual Situations.
