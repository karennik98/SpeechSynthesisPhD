Ground truth:
This is a family movie that was broadcast on my local ITV station at 1.00 am a couple of nights ago .
Come on there's nothing kids like more than sadism and that's why Roald Dahl was such a popular author for children .
It also explains why DOCTOR WHO was such a successful show across the world .
In this screenplay you're just dying for pulp fiction author to do something nasty to the kids but this doesn't happen .
I'm not advocating child abuse but to see Howard Spitz lose his rag at the little ones would have made the movie rather better .
Can you imagine how much worse KINDERGARTEN COP would have been if the producers had gone all PC ?
I mean if you're making a movie centered around a children's author who hates children shouldn't the story show and not tell ?
Much of the problem lies with director Vadim Jean and you do get the feeling he doesn't know how to handle the material which is bad news for the movie .
As someone previously noted the soundtrack is haphazard and Kelsey Grammar is very wooden .
But at the end of the day the main problem remains that the potential is ruined because no one wanted to offend the audiences sensibilities
