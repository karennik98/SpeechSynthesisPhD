Ground truth:
I had been looking forward to this movie since Lost World came out.
It didn't bother me that Lost World wasn't as intellectual as the original, and here, I was just hoping for a good monster movie.
It was all about "Dinosaurs eat people."
Also, while there was no shortage of variety in the dinosaur community, there were not nearly "enough" dinosaurs.
The figures I've read put their body weight at about 15 pounds, while the movie made them look closer to 300.
Worse, they didn't get to eat anybody, or even splatter them on the rocks by dropping them from high up.
There was no ending to the movie, either, it was just, all of the sudden, credits.
Go rent the Carnosaur series; at least you won't be disappointed.
