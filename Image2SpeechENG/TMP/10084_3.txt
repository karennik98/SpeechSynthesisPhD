Ground truth:
Tyra & the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter don't care to see all the ridiculous modeling to sell something.
Weird locations, too much makeup & too much skin is not necessary.
Sex does not always sell when you are selling to women.
The same goes for the horse stomping runway walk that looks unnatural.
People come in all shapes & sizes & they need to have that on the show.
My daughter has a 36" inseam, is tall & slender & a size 5, I am more average at a size 12.
We would like to see both- I can not picture how something would look on me when a size 2 is wearing it, it will not fit the same way on me.
I do not buy magazines anymore because they are one sided on this matter.
We would really love the show to consider women of all sizes.
Thank you.
