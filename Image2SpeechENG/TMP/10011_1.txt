Ground truth:
A big disappointment for what was touted as an incredible film.
Incredibly bad.
Very pretentious.
It would be nice if just once someone would create a high profile role for a young woman that was not a prostitute.
We don't really learn anything about this character, except that he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic.
We don't know why.
Nicholas Cage turns in an excellent performance as usual, but I feel that this role and this script let him down.
And how, after not being able to perform for the whole film, can he have an erection on his deathbed?
Really terrible and I felt like I needed a bath.
