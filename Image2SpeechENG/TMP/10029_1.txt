Ground truth:
Unlike Evil Dead it never gains any speed at all.
The gore is horrible.
The "climax" is such a total joke, its hard to laugh at it is so bad.
The back of the box says "The ending will shock and haunt you."
One person is killed with an axe in the whole movie and it is off screen.A true 1 out of 10.
I LOVE laughing at bad movies, but this one is so bad that it even lacks campy qualities.
No bad movie night is compete without a true character building flick :P


Corrected:
Unlike Evil Dead, it never gains any speed or value.
The gote is horribie.
The "climax" is such a total joke, it's hard to laugh at it. $5.

"The Back of the box says, "The ending will shock and haunt you":

-One: person is killed with an axe.

-Two: people are killed with a knife.

In the whole movie, and at the end, the main character is left standing alone.
It is off screen: A true-1 out of 10.
