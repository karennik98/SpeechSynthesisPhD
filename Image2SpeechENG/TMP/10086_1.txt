Ground truth:
Tyra Banks needs to teach these girls that it's not all about being beautiful on the outside.
The inside counts for something too.
A lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls.
I see Tyra less involved with the girls in every season.
About the only thing worth watching Top Model for is Mr. Jay Manuel.
Recently, Tyra had a contestant who was a pre-op transsexual.
I felt that she should have done more to encourage her.
It was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine look.
Tyra should have given her tips or perhaps she could have sent resident Trannie Ms. Jay to help the girl out.
Instead, the contestant was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism.
It's a shame because I truly enjoyed the first 3 seasons.
There's a reason why Project Runway has all 4 seasons out on DVD and Top Model only has 1 season on DVD.
It's called taste.
Top Model seriously needs a lot of revamping an some more humanity.
