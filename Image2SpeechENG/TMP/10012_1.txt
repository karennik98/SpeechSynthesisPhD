Ground truth:
This film is absolutely appalling and awful.
It's not low budget, it's a no budget film that makes Ed Wood's movies look like art.
The acting is abysmal but sets and props are worse then anything I have ever seen.
There is sadism as you would expect from an 80s Italian video nasty.
No talent was used to make this film.
And the female love interest has a huge bhind- Italian taste maybe.
This piece of crap has no entertainment value whatsoever and it's not even funny, just boring and extremely cheap.
It's actually and insult to the most stupid audience.
I just wonder how on earth an actor like Woody Strode ended up ia a turkey like this?
