Ground truth:
Of course,and you know this already, they begin getting killed one by one by amysterious stranger.
The cast features Carel Struycken, of "TheWitches of Eastwick" and the Addams family movies.
Sadly, hedoes not pop up until the very end of the film, and is covered inburn makeup, rendering him unrecognizable.
Steve Bond (anyoneremember him?)
is here in an early role as a victim.Brown's direction, and the script he cowrote, both smell like thepresents brown bears leave in the woods.
He pads the film withso much stock wilderness footage, I thought I accidentally rented aspecial episode of Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.
Much of thecast sits around the campfire and eats, then walk, and sit and eatagain.
The forest ranger is involved in the strangest scene ever putin a slasher film: he tells a joke about a wide mouthed frog to ababy deer.
The killer, a forest firesurvivor looking for a mate, watches the students from behindtrees.
