Ground truth:
Donald Sutherland, an American paleontologist visiting England, picks up a hitch hiker one evening.
Two years later, having discovered the man's address book in his car, he returns the book to the man's opulent home, only to find that the man's been hanged for murder.
Redundancy is perfectly okay.
We have to keep the characters and the time lines straight.
Christie's movies are of the rare kind in which the use of famous faces in subordinate characters is actually useful.
(Jacqueline de Bellefort?
Oh, yes, that's Mia Farrow.)
After that, everything is flung at the viewer in disjointed scraps, often in sudden flashbacks or in confusing voiceovers that tell us nothing.
The script has a slapdash quality, as if thrown together by two hacks overnight.
Few of the faces are familiar and that doesn't help at all.
Everyone drops remarks about everyone else and the names become a hopeless jumble.
The musical score consists of four instruments doing irritating atonal jazz riffs.
Some nudity is thrown in to wake up the dozers in the audience.
If Dame Agatha were alive, she'd be among the viewers who needed to be shaken awake.Dullsville.
