Ground truth:
It's clear that for this film they wanted to have the story line driven by the characters.
But immediately the story line causes you to dislike the new main characters.
The fly-over of the island and dinosaurs below lacked any impact at all and almost looked like a cartoon.
The all action entrance to the island is merely a rehash of parts from JP 1 and 2.
The story-line is predictable to the point of annoyance and it's entirely unsatisfying end left me feeling cheated.
This gave me with no option but to award the film 3/10!
