Ground truth:
How could anyone who liked the previous JP movies even stand to sit through this 1 hour of drivel?
There are so many stupid things about this film it's mind boggling!!
I remember when i went to see JP as a kid it was my favorite movie and franchise, the acting, the SFX the Music, the direction!
all fantastic, JP2 in my opinion was OK pretty much the same apart from some really stupid moments (like the gymnast girl kicking a raptor..please!)
but on a whole a watchable and reasonable cinematic experience.But the the third one has no point!!
for example: 1) The "new" mega Spinosaurus - Seriously, what the hell!!
This thing follows them everywhere they go, they cannot escape it's presence and yet in The lost world (the same island) do you see it once?
do you hear it?
does anyone even MENTION it?
NO!
Its ridiculous!.
The star character in the previous 2 movies was, and always will be the T-Rex so what does the d(urr)irector "Joe Johnston" go and do?
Kill it off!
not a single explanation!
and don't get me started on the whole satellite-phone-in-the-Dino-belly thing!
2)Just when you start to get over how stupid the Spinosaurus is you see the Raptors, Aside from their new "Punk" Haircuts they seem pretty credible!
*Phew* they will make this movie watchable right?...
WRONG!
now they speak to each other!!
and the excuse for them speaking in this film and not in the First and second are...wait for it... Evolution!
- yes the process of millions of years in just a few months from when the second movie ended, amazing!
surly they should have grown opposable thumbs and created tools by now!!
