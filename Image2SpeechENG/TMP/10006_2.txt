Ground truth:
Being a long-time fan of Japanese film, I expected more than this.
I can't really be bothered to write to much, as this movie is just so poor.
If you've noticed how many Japanese movies use characters, plots and twists that seem too "different", forcedly so, then steer clear of this movie.
